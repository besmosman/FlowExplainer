/// These noise functions were written by Squirrel Eiserloh as a cheap and simple substitute for
/// the [sometimes awful] bit-noise sample code functions commonly found on the web, many of which
/// are hugely biased or terribly patterned, e.g. having bits which are on (or off) 75% or even
/// 100% of the time (or are excessively overkill/slow for our needs, such as MD5 or SHA).
///
/// Note: This is work in progress; not all functions have been tested.  Use at your own risk.
/// Please report any bugs, issues, or bothersome cases to SquirrelEiserloh at gmail.com.
///
/// The following functions are all based on a simple bit-noise hash function which returns an
/// unsigned integer containing 32 reasonably-well-scrambled bits, based on a given (signed)
/// integer input parameter (position/index) and [optional] seed.  Kind of like looking up a
/// value in an infinitely large [non-existent] table of previously rolled random numbers.
///
/// These functions are deterministic and random-access / order-independent (i.e. state-free),
/// so they are particularly well-suited for use in smoothed/fractal/simplex/Perlin noise
/// functions and out-of-order (or on-demand) procedural content generation (i.e. that mountain
/// village is the same whether you generated it first or last, ahead of time or just now).
///
/// The N-dimensional variations simply hash their multidimensional coordinates down to a single
/// 32-bit index and then proceed as usual, so while results are not unique they should
/// (hopefully) not seem locally predictable or repetitive.
